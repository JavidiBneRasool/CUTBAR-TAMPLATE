## üöÄ What's Different from the React Version:

Since Blogger doesn't support real-time databases or React components, I've adapted the template to:
- Use Blogger's built-in comment system instead of custom comments
- Display blog posts instead of live chat messages
- Keep all the visual animations and design elements
- Maintain the same professional appearance and user experience

## üì± Preview:
Once installed, your blog will have:
- The same beautiful animated background with flying butterflies
- The sheep icon prominently displayed in the header
- A professional financial community appearance
- All your blog posts displayed with the modern card design
- Full comment functionality through Blogger's system

The template maintains the exact same visual appeal as your React application while being fully compatible with Blogger's platform!
